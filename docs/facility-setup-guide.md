At the bottom of the Facility Setup page, you can enable or disable various system modules:

## Best Practices

4. **Regular Updates**: Update unit configurations when physical changes are made to the unit

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Facility Setup page:

1. Refresh the page to reload all configurations
2. Ensure all required fields are completed when creating a unit
3. Check that room ranges are properly formatted (e.g., "401-412")
